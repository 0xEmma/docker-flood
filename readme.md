# docker-flood

> The perfect match between a highly customizable torrent client and an awesome web ui.

This repo holds dockerfiles used to create a flood web ui instance using rtorrent as backend. It was created to be easily deployed using a single `docker-compose`. These dockerfiles are based on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org) for minimalist and lightweight images.
